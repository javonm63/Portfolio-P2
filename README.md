🧭 Overview

FreelancerInnvoice.com (FLI.COM) is a free, full-stack invoice management web application designed for freelancers and their clients.

The platform consists of two sides — Client and Freelancer — each equipped with its own tailored set of tools. Users can create, send, receive, pay, and track invoices with ease. The goal is to provide a powerful, reliable, and intuitive all-in-one platform for managing invoices and payments without any subscriptions or hidden costs.

This version of FLI.COM was built entirely in vanilla JavaScript on the frontend to demonstrate full control over the logic, structure, and UI without relying on frameworks.

🎯 Project Goal

The goal for this project was to design, develop, and deploy a production-ready full-stack web application that:

Solves the problem of finding a free, user-friendly invoice management tool

Includes all essential features for freelancers and clients alike

Features a secure REST API and scalable backend architecture

Is hosted on its own custom domain

Experiments with a frontend UI inspired by Apple’s iOS 26 “liquid glass” design language

💡 The Problem

Have you ever tried to make an invoice online?
Most platforms hide even the most basic features behind expensive monthly subscriptions.

FreelancerInnvoice.com was created to change that — offering a completely free, secure, and intuitive solution for making, sending, receiving, and paying invoices online.

Whether you’re an independent freelancer or a small business owner, FLI.COM helps you manage your workflow without barriers or fees.
