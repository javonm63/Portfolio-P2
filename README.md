🧭 Overview

FreelancerInnvoice.com (FLI.COM) is a free, full-stack invoice management web application designed for freelancers and their clients. The platform provides an all-in-one solution for creating, sending, receiving, paying, and tracking invoices — without costly subscriptions or unnecessary complexity.

This version of FLI.COM is built using vanilla JavaScript on the frontend, with a focus on clean architecture, responsive design, and scalability for production deployment.

🎯 Project Goal

The primary goal of this project was to design, develop, and deploy a full-stack application with:

A production-ready frontend and secure backend/database

A REST API that supports authentication, CRUD operations, and payment flow

A custom domain deployment with real-world scalability

A solution to a real problem: the lack of accessible, free online invoice management tools

💡 The Problem

Most platforms require expensive monthly subscriptions or limit functionality behind paywalls.
